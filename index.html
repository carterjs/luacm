				<h1>Lehigh ACM</h1>
				<p>
					We are Lehigh's chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery
					(ACM). As such, we participate in ACM events like the Intercollege
					Programming Competition (ICPC), where teams race to code the solutions
					to a series of logic puzzles.
				</p>

				<h1>Goals</h1>
				<p>
					Class is great, but it can't teach you everything. Courses at Lehigh
					focus on core programming concepts and theory, and unfortunately don't
					ever go much into practical applications.
				</p>
				<p>
					We're hoping to fill that gap by running a series of workshops where
					you'll learn skills like web development, game development, modern
					software engineering best practices and styles, and more that they
					don't teach you in the classroom!

				<h1>Leadership</h1>
				<p>Leaders? Nah we don't have those.</p>

				<h1>Events</h1>
				<p>
					<strong
						>Our events and hackathons bring together the programming
						community.</strong
					>
					Events are open to everyone, no matter what level of programming
					experience. The events are a great way to meet and learn from other
					programmers in the Lehigh community as well as a place where you can
					show off what you've learned and earn great prizes from sponsors such
					as Google, IBM, Lutron, and more!
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong
						>LU Apps application development competition is a competition held
						in the fall where students develop and showcase an
						application.</strong
					>
					The application can be anything from a game to schedule planner, and
					there are prizes given out by many big name corporate sponsors!
				</p>
				<h2>Upcoming events</h2>
				<p>
					We probably won't have any events in person this year, but it sure
					would be cool to have some more workshops virtually!
